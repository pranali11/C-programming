This is trial code, to practice github and git commands for version control 
steps for saving your job on github

1. Create a respository on github account for example C-programming
2. Copy the link 
3. go to the folder where your code resides
4. intilize git - git init  , This will create an empty git directory 
5. using add command add the codes or items you need to commit - git add <file_names>
6. commit on your first version - git commit -m "first commit"
7. now you need to push the work before we need to specify where- 
git remote add github <URL of the respository you created>
8.git push -m origin
9. It will ask for username and password of the github.
